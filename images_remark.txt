# TEMPORARY USE ONLY
# this is for personal remark of different images built during the testing stage

General format of naming images = <hub_user>/ros2:<tag-MMDD-purpose>

General naming of tag:
<base> = "base" core image
<built> = base core image that already "colcon-built"
<basemod> = modified base image for testing
<builtmod> = modified colcon-built image for testing

----------------------------------------------
[RUNDOWN]
- Build the "base core image" (without colcon build the ros2_ws)
- Run the core image
- Colcon build the core image (colcon build --symlink-install)
    - maximum time needed: 10 min (on Win11)
- Save the container as the "colcon-built core image"
- Run the colcon-built core image
- Test

After testing, integrate the changes into base core image 
and go through the rundown again.
